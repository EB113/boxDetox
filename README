-------------------------------------
This tool intends to aid in exam by reducing painfull stuff.
This is not a problem solver tool.

Features:
	- Buffer Overflow Helper
	- Enumeration Automation Helper (Modules will not be made available.Try Harder and make them yourself, follow the examples!)
	- File Sharing Helper
	- Buckets to keep track of cracked passwords and notes
	- Priv Esc Helper (Text Notes)

The main goal is to allow the user to create their own enumeration by using python scripts.

Enumeration Automation:
Relevant Classes:
	- Module
	- Portscan (Specfic type of Module)
	- Profile
Relevant Files:
	- test.tpl (json structure to automate enumeration, user specifies a portscan module and specifies which modules run on specific ports. Modules only run if port is open.)

Examples:
	- Module_Ping (Inheritance of Module)
	- Module_TCPCommon (Inheritance of Portscan)

ToDo...
